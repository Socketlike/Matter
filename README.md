# Matter
<<<<<<< HEAD
A theme for Replugged that focuses on being sorta modular, because being whole is overrated.
=======
An atom is a very small thing.  
Combine a ton of them, and you get what's normally called "matter".  

> **Note** This theme is a **work in progress**. The current look of the theme is subject to change.
> Things might also look really bad (ex. white text on a bright background).
